    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love cheese, pasta, and pepper? This dish is often referred to as 'adult mac and cheese', eliciting nostalgic memories of consuming copious portions of Kraft as a child-- but with a mature, upscale twist. Whether you're after a quick lunch or a romantic home-cooked dinner, cacio e pepe is the perfect comfort food for all occasions.</p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g bucatini or spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>25g butter</li>
        <li>2tsp ground whole black peppercorns (or 1tsp freshly ground black pepper)</li>
        <li>50g pecorino or parmesan, finely grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta 2 minutes shy of box directions in salted, boiling water. Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium pan over low heat, and toast black pepper for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, saving 200ml of the pasta water. Add cooked pasta and half of pasta water into pan with butter and pepper. Toss briefly.</li>
        <li>Scatter over the parmesan evenly, but don't stir-- wait for cheese to melt for 30 seconds. Once melted, toss everything well and stir together, adding more pasta water as needed.</li>
        <li> Serve immediately with a fresh grating of black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
