This is my attempt at the first project in The Odin Project curriculum.

## Purpose

I am currently a senior in the Informatics program at the University of Washington's iSchool, set to graduate by August of this year. This course was alluring because it pitches a self-paced learning path for beginners-- while I am not a pure beginner, I am not yet confident in my abilities and feel this program could help me learn new topics, solidify older knowledge, and prepare me for a career in web development after I graduate. 

As far as this specific project goes, it is intended to demonstrate my basic understanding of HTML. 

## Setting Up/ Getting Started

This version of the project is just a few HTML files-- no additional setup should be required to view this in a modern web browser. 

## Future Plans

While this version of the project is just a simple HTML document, TOP promises that this project will be slowly iterated on over time as new skills are learned in the program. I anticipate that CSS and hopefully JS will be added to this project, and will update this repo when I get to those sections in this curriculum.
